focusVoteServer
===============
a Microsoft-oriented server for the focusVote web app. i'm using this to compare and contrast with the original MEAN stack. some things being demonstrated here:

* Web API
* CQRS
 * SQL Server and EF for the write model
 * RavenDB and Dapper for the read model

i'll probably evaluate some of the following along the way:

* Rx for .NET
* RabbitMQ
